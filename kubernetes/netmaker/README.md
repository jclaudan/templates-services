# Netmaker

WireGuardÂ® automation from homelab to enterprise.
Netmaker controls the Wireguard configuration on your nodes via MQTT. If you want your Netmaker instance to also act as an egress or ingress node, you need to install the Netmaker client on your nodes.
Wirguard should already be installed on all nodes.
