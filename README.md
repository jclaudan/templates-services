# Christopher's Templates for container deployment

This Repository contains my customized templates for deploying container instances via Docker or Kubernetes.

I mostly use "Traefik Proxy" or "Cloudflare Tunnel" as reverse proxy in my environments, so don't be confused about the $PROXY_NETWORK variable and the fact that no ports are exposed directly.

So... always setup your proxy instances first!
